# RosFuscator
YouTube/Livestream project for obfuscating C# source code using Roslyn


# Todo /Fixes
Some of MANY that needs to be fixed before automated usage
* Make sure i don't obfuscate a method that is demanded by an interface i cannot modify.
* Make sure i don't obfuscate strings that needs to be constant
* Make sure strings that are obfuscated can reach the xorEncDec Function.
